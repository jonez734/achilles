<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer that is commonly used in
food.  It is a salt of the amino acid glutamate, <strike>which is found naturally in
many foods, including meat, dairy products, and vegetables.</strike></p>

<p>When <strike>MSG</strike> glutamate comes into contact with a cell, it
can interact with receptors on the surface of the cell membrane.  These
receptors, known as glutamate receptors, are found on cells throughout the
body and are involved in a variety of functions, including learning, memory,
and the transmission of signals between nerve cells.</p>

<p>When <strike>MSG</strike> glutamate binds to these receptors, it can activate them and cause the cell
to respond in a specific way.  For example, it may stimulate the release of
neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transmit signals between nerve
cells.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified illustration of the process of MSG coming into contact with a
cell:</p>

<ul>
<li>MSG is consumed and enters the body through the digestive system.</li>
<li>It is absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to various parts of the
body.</li>
<li>MSG comes into contact with a cell, such as a nerve cell or a muscle
cell.</li>
<li>MSG binds to receptors on the surface of the cell membrane.</li>
<li>The binding of MSG to the receptors activates the receptors and causes the cell to respond in a specific way.</li>
<li>The response of the cell may include the release of neurotransmitters or other chemicals, or the activation of specific pathways within the
cell.</li>
</ul>
