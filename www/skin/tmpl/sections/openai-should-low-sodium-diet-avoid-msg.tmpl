<p>If you are following a low sodium diet, it is generally recommended to
avoid or limit the use of flavor enhancers, such as MSG (monosodium
glutamate), as they can contribute to your overall sodium intake.  While MSG
is not a source of sodium <b>on the label</b><strike>itself</strike>, it is
often used in conjunction with salt and other sodium-containing ingredients,
which can add to the sodium content of the foods in which it is used.</p>

<p>It is important to note that flavor enhancers, including MSG, are not
essential for human health and are used mainly to improve the taste and
appeal of foods.  If you are following a low sodium diet, it is generally
recommended to focus on whole, unprocessed foods that are naturally low in
sodium, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole
grains.  These foods can help you meet your nutrient needs while keeping
your sodium intake within the recommended range.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the sodium content of the foods you eat, it is
recommended to read food labels carefully and to choose foods that are low
in sodium.  You can also try using herbs, spices, and other flavorful
ingredients to add flavor to your foods without the need for added sodium or
other flavor enhancers.</p>
