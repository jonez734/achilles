<p>2024-10-10: is msg manufactured?</p>

<p>Yes, MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a manufactured product. While glutamate itself is a naturally occurring amino acid found in many foods, MSG is specifically produced in a laboratory through a fermentation process. This involves using microorganisms to break down plant-based materials like sugarcane or corn, resulting in the production of glutamic acid, which is then combined with sodium to form
MSG.</p>
