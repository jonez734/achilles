<p>It is not clear how long symptoms of sensitivity to MSG (monosodium
glutamate) may last, as this can vary from person to person.  Some people
may experience symptoms shortly after consuming MSG, while others may not
experience symptoms until several hours later.  The severity and duration of
symptoms may also vary.</p>

<p>Symptoms of sensitivity to MSG are often referred to as "MSG symptom
complex" or "Chinese restaurant syndrome," although the term "Chinese
restaurant syndrome" is not recognized by the scientific community and the
relationship between MSG and these symptoms is not well understood. 
Symptoms that have been associated with MSG sensitivity include headache,
facial pressure or tightness, flushing, and numbness or tingling in the
face, neck, and other areas of the body.</p>

can be consumed as part of a healthy diet <span class="highlight">in
appropriate amounts</span>.</p>
