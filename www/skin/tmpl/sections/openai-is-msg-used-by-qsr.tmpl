<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer that is commonly used in the food industry, including in quick service restaurants. MSG is used to enhance the natural flavors of food and add a savory or "umami" taste. It is commonly used in soups, sauces, snack foods, and other processed
foods.</p>

<p>Quick service restaurants, also known as fast food restaurants, often serve a variety of processed and prepared foods that may contain MSG. However, the use of MSG in quick service restaurants can vary depending on the specific restaurant and the type of food they serve. Some restaurants may use MSG in their dishes, while others may
not.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that MSG is a controversial ingredient and some people may be sensitive to it. Some people may experience side effects after consuming MSG, such as headaches, flushing, and allergic reactions. These reactions are rare and are generally mild, but some people may be more sensitive to MSG than others. If you are sensitive to MSG or have concerns about consuming it, it is a good idea to check the ingredient list of the food you are considering purchasing at a quick service restaurant or to ask the staff about the use of MSG in their
dishes.</p>
